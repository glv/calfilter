* Greatly improve (i.e., existing) RDocs

* Ensure timezone information is retained

* Improved set of TripIt methods

* Other specialized methods (say, for GCalendar or ICal feeds)

* Higher-level methods (say, "privatize" to replace all information with
  a "Private" or "Busy" description)

* Some date manipulation methods (e.g., my calendar might have the actual
  appointment time for some events, but for display to others I might want
  to enlarge it to incorporate travel time to and from)

* Similar to the cgi module, it should be easy to require modules
  to turn a filter into a camping app, a webrick service, etc.
